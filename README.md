## 📌 Characteristics

-   **🧬 Generator:** Gives you the ability to select a base (_a positive integer_) for the number system, and based on it you can input a character to represent each digit, these can be **ANY** valid Unicode character, like a letter, a number, an emoji, or a special character.

-   **🧮 Calculator:** Based on the previously generated number system, you can make conversions from decimal to your own system, and from your own system to decimal.

-   **🧠 How it works?:** There is a section to learn how number system works (_bases, digits, conversions, ..._), and a little about how the site code works.
